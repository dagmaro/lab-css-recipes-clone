          This was my grandmother's apple pie recipe. I have never seen another one<br>quite like it. It will always
    be my favorite and has won me several first place<br>prizes in local competitions. I hope it becomes one of your
    favorites as well!

        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Melt the butter in a saucepan. Stir in<br>flour to form a paste. Add water, white sugar and brown sugar, and bring to a boil. Reduce<br>temperature and let simmer.</li>
          <li>Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded slightly. Cover with a<br>lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly so<br>that it does not run off.</li>
          <li>Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175<br>degrees C). Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes, until apples are soft.</li>
